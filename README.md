# bike-share-hour-predictions

In this project, I aim to analyze and predict bike-sharing usage patterns using a provided dataset. Bike-sharing systems have gained popularity in urban areas, offering a convenient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. By understanding the factors influencing bike rental trends, we can optimize bike-sharing programs and infrastructure to better serve users' needs.
